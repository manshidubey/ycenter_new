So I quit my corporate job on first day and took off to Mozambique, Africa. Next 5 months, I spent working on the ground in a rural hospital.

										</p>
										<p class="col-sm-8 col-md-offset-2">Despite 6 years of engineering, I found myself ill-prepared to translate my classroom knowledge into skills for real world problem solving. To fill this gap and bring our education closer to the challenges of our world today, we launched Ycenter.</p>
